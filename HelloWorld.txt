Why did the habit tracker break up with the calendar?

Because it kept getting graphed! Every week it was the same old story—the chart showed they were "doing great" on Monday, "completely ghosted" by Friday, and by Sunday the graph looked like a sad rollercoaster that gave up halfway through the ride. The tracker said, "I can't track someone who only shows up in my interface when they feel guilty!" 😅
